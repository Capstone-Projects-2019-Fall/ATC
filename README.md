# ATC
Autonomous-Tracking-Car

## Features 
1) ATC can be driven by the webapp generated by running the app.py file. The web app had the commands to make the car move left, right, forwards, and backwards. 
2) ATC has the ability to take photos and store photos using the "take picture" button. 
3) ATC can show a live stream of what the car sees
4) ATC can do a simple follow me going fowards to follow the user as the user gets further away from the car.

## Bugs 
1) The follow me feature is not completely matured. It can only follow the users if they are in frame and are only moving away or closer to the vehichle, the vehicle cannot turn with the follow me feature.
2) The frames per second and live stream is off by an average of a  second from real time (may vary due to internet connection) 

## How to run ATC 
This you will need:
  Arduino 
  Raspberry pi 
  Picamera 
  ATC car

1) use the program you must be on the raspberry pi and have access to a screen or you can ssh into a pi, if you prefer the latter you can follow this guide https://itsfoss.com/ssh-into-raspberry/

2) Then you will need to activate the picamera on the raspiberry pi, here a tutorial on how enable it          https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/camera.md

2) Once you sucesssfully have the pi setup with the picamera enabled you can now git clone the master branch to get started with the program. 

3) From the ATC folder run the command: pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
   this will get the required dependencies fo you to build the project
